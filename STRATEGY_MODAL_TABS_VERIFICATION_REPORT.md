## Testing Notes

This test was conducted using browser automation to systematically verify all tabs in the strategy performance modal. The tests check:

1. **Tab Functionality** - Whether each tab loads and displays appropriate content
2. **Data Accuracy** - Whether performance metrics and strategy information are correct
3. **Navigation** - Whether users can switch between tabs smoothly
4. **Data Persistence** - Whether data remains consistent when switching tabs
5. **Consistency** - Whether information matches across all tabs
6. **Multi-Strategy Support** - Whether tabs work correctly for different strategies

### Key Findings:
- Tests were conducted with the available 92 trades (instead of expected 1,000)
- All three tabs (Overview, Performance, Rules) were tested for functionality
- Tab navigation and data persistence were verified
- Multiple strategies were tested to ensure consistent functionality
